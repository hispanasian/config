# Config

This is my configuration for my `HOME` directory. This will be a `.config` folder that resides in your `HOME` directory and can be referenced from there.

## Setup

1. First, we need to create `.config`
```bash
git clone git@github.com:hispanasian/config.git ~/.config
```
2. Now we can reference it. A sample [.profile](.profile) file is found here. You can copy it:
```bash
cd ~/.config
cp -f .profile ~/.profile
```
